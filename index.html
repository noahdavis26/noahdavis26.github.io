<h4>Camp Olami, Sabes JCC, Minneapolis, MN - Summers of 2010-2014</h4>
<p> In five summers with Camp Olami - A Jewish day camp run through the Sabes JCC - I covered the roles of Director of Sports Programming, Special Needs Advocate, and Senior Counselor. Each position provided a unique and important learning experience. As a counselor I was responsible for the wellbeing of a group of 10 five-year-old campers as I led them through organized activities through out the day. My work as a special needs advocate had me cater to one specific special needs camper at a time. The purpose of being an advocate was to help the special needs camper remain involved with his group and participate actively throughout the day. As director of sports programming I led the sports station for all of the camp. I would see each group in the camp at least once throughout the course of the week and taught a variety of sports that included basketball, football, kickball and soccer, and track and field.
